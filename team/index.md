# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Our lab is a highly engaged and collaborative team of researchers. We believe that diverse teams do better science, so we work to create an environment where everyone is treated equitably and our differences are respected and valued.

**We are actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students to join our team. Please see [CONTACT]({% link contact/index.md %}) for more information.**
